# Background

I like riding motorcycles. Sometimes I end up searching for motorcycle keys on riding day. So I started searching
for a solution to make my bike keyless. I found some products but they were not completely keyless—I still had to
carry a fob. I want to use my mobile phone as a key, similar to how Tesla uses a phone as a key. There is no solution
in the market that meets my requirements. Since I come from an electronics and computing background with programming
experience—and I’ve built cool hobby projects in the past—I decided to build the project myself.
